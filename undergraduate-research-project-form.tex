\section*{Course Description}

	Undergraduate research courses broaden the scope of a student's studies, improve availability of research opportunities to students, provide interdisciplinary researching opportunities, and opportune the learning and application of practical skills.
	
	The ideal undergraduate research project produces either a contribution to the researching community or an industry.
	These courses are open for every subject to all students in the Faculty of Science, e.g. a computer science student may take a BIOC 396 or MIMM 397.

\subsection*{Recommended Prerequisites}

	Should the student have a developed skillset that allows them to carry out their project, all prerequisites may be waived with approval of the supervising professor and the course administrator.
	
	Recommended prerequisites include:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item At least one term of undergraduate study
		\item A CGPA of 3.0 or more
		\item Two or more 200-300 level courses in the chosen field
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Course Terms}

		These courses are open to all students in the faculty of science, but cannot be taken more than once with the same professor.
		Additionally, each project must be for a different course.
		The courses are worth 3 credits.
		Your project is an elective that may be approved as a course towards a major with permission of both the supervising professor and the administrator for the course.
		
\subsection*{General Project Expectations}
		
		This section by no means specifies the expectations for \textit{your} undergraduate research project but is intended to provide a guideline for what may be expected of you for an appropriate project should you as the student want to propose your own.
		An undergraduate research project generally consists of a student doing original research in a field, often working towards a publication.
		Reproduction of significant results in the field have also been performed as excellent undergraduate projects.
		
		The final presentation, should there be one, will be approximately 10 minutes and will usually be delivered to the other students in your field also doing a 396/397 course.
		Accordingly, craft your presentation as though for a lecture hall to introduce your project and its purposes to a general undergraduate class.
		The details of the grading of your presentation should be discussed with your supervisor.
		
		The report is usually handed in before the last day of the semester, but sometimes will be requested earlier.
		Reports tend to be between 20 and 50 pages long; reports as long as 100 pages are neither unheard of nor likely read thoroughly; and reports are expected to be at least 10 good pages.
		You are highly encouraged to produce a professional report with high quality diagrams, proper figure legends, and multiple citations.
		To go above and beyond, try typesetting in LaTeX and preparing your report as though for publication.

\section{Project Information}

	\subsection{Project Description}
	
		\TextField[name = projectdescription, width = \textwidth, multiline = true, height = 10.2em, value = {Detailed characterisation and manipulation of protein interactions, structures, and binding sites is vital to understanding and controlling biological systems as proteins, including enzymes that accelerate reactions, components to microscopic structures like cytoskeleton, regulatory activators and inhibitors, signalling bodies, etc., affect nearly all aspects of an organism's   function.  To simulate the binding activity of a computationally mutated protein, the conformation of mutated residues must be predicted with some accuracy.  This study will use mutations and conformations within the Protein Data Bank to assess the predictability of residue conformations based on their environment and will further attempt to predict these structures if possible.  Techniques used will include nearest neighbour clustering algorithms and Gaussian mixture models.}]{}
		
	\subsection{Judging the Project}
	
		\TextField[name = projectjudgment, width = \textwidth, multiline = true, height = 4.2em, value = {The success of the project will be judged primarily by the certainty of predictability of conformations based on their environments, in particular the degree of certainty and the techniques used to reach this certainty that are outsided of the few published works on this topic.}]{}
